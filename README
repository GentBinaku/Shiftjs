NODE JS MONGO DB finally did it 

can start programing the login page should have administarve rights to tell me which user is logged in


FOR mongo authentication

db.createUser(
  {
    user: "root1",
    pwd: "root1",
    roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" } ]
  }
)

DB path:
/mnt/mongodb/db

mongod --dbpath /mnt/mongodb/db

Database with authentication set up
